ldd0e6,gpcqm3a,t2_16jhc2,"My super conservative Southern Baptist MIL is hella mad at me for getting vaccinated for a few reasons:

1. ‚ÄúY‚Äôall haven‚Äôt even begun to have children, who knows what it‚Äôs doing to your dna?‚Äù Her point was that vaccines cause autism therefore our future children could be autistic since I‚Äôve been vaccinated. As an autistic person with several autistic family members, I had to be the one to break it to her that if our kids are autistic, it‚Äôs because there is a genetic predisposition to autism on my side of the family, not because I got vaxxed. 

2. ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt trust what the government says.‚Äù Fair, I don‚Äôt either, which is why I am listening to scientists. 

3. ‚ÄúYour FIL‚Äôs cousin Mark is a doctor and he said he‚Äôs not gonna get the vaccine because he‚Äôs not done having kids and he said the other doctors he works with aren‚Äôt gonna get vaccinated either.‚Äù Okay but why would I listen to Mark - a doctor in buttfuck nowhere Alabama - and his coworkers - also doctors in buttfuck nowhere Alabama - over the hundreds of thousands of doctors that ARE comfortable with the vaccine or any of the doctors that have made this shit their life‚Äôs work? 


She‚Äôs been giving me the silent treatment for the last three weeks after I told her I‚Äôd rather get vaccinated and have a living breathing autistic child than get covid and miscarry or die during childbirth. I got my second shot today and feel great üòö",1614668556.0,0.0,1.0,N,,3/2/21 1:02

Right after she started trying chiropractic adjustments she asked me to go with her. The moment I walked into this place my stomach went south as she went into the back I began to look around the place and it got worse. Pamphlets saying it could reverse autism and asthma to one saying it could cure cancer.

After she came out I rushed her out the door and immediately told her to never come back.
She asked why and I told her the truth ""these people are quacks"" and she said they had a doctor in the building...funny thing. No they didn't. They had no license or diploma on display. They literally told my mom that they were doctors!

So after this I showed her the facts about it and she asked her doctor who confirmed. But during that lunch as I was going off I mentioned that their claims were as stupid as saying vaccines cause autism. Mom said ""well...."" and I shut it down because I know that she KNOWS better than this being a former preschool teacher! I asked where she got the info and ""your aunt on Facebook"" and I groaned told her that my aunt was full of shit and next time she tells you stuff ask for proof.

She also apparently thought that it was government controlled which was pretty easy to shut down. Since ya know. Even in a pandemic they can't work together. Its the scientists that gave us the current vaccines not the governments.

My two concerns are:

1. I can't help but feel a little suspicious about the fact that 4 or 5 manufacturers/producers/labs announced the completion of their new vaccine all within a span of a month or so. Given that each product operates using a unique method, I find it a little strange that they all became available at relatively the same time. I'm not necessarily claiming that there must have been some conspiracy or fowl-play involved here, but I would certainly appreciate if anyone could explain the coincidental logistics of how that happened.
2. I'm more than happy to drop point number 1 if these vaccine weren't so rushed. Now I understand that this pandemic ushered in an incredible global effort to develop this vaccine as soon as possible, but I distinctly remember last February when health ministers around the world said that this vaccine would take at least 18-24 months to develop. I hardly ever fall for conspiracies but given what this pandemic has done to the global economies, governments obviously have an immense incentive to push out a vaccine as quickly as possible. And as far as I can tell, there's no way of truly knowing whether or not any steps were skipped during the development of this vaccine.

I live in Dubai, UAE and the Sinopharm (China) and Pfizer-BioNTech (US) vaccines are becoming almost readily available for the general public. Furthermore, many companies are pushing for their employees to take the vaccine (obviously to limit any further paid sick leaves). I'm not completely shutting down the possibility of taking the vaccine but I would definitely like these points addressed before I take it.

Looking forward to your responses!

Wow! This is peak r/selfawarewolves unless this person has a degree in a field related to vaccines... Oh wait, I forgot they think degree=shills and that 10 minutes reading a blog &gt; years of medical school.

BTW, for anyone wondering: yes! 1 year is a record time to create a vaccine... If you are creating it from scratch. There were a lot of coronavirus  research teams (not sars-cov2, but coronaviruses in general) around the globe studying how to create a vaccine that targets coronaviruses. Fortunately, lots of these findings could be used to target sars cov2. Also, the fact that governments and private businesses invested heavily in the research and development of said vaccine helped out A LOT. 

I guess, what I'm saying is :trust and invest in science, its a good thing when you question science and safety protocols, but do use critical thinking and the correct information.

I can't stress this enough:the fact that you (in this case, antivaxxers) don't understand the scientific basis, is not an argument against the research.

lwt85y,gpj1zt0,t2_i1evx,"I'll be honest, I was previously a little sceptical of this vaccine given it had been approved before any published efficacy data, but fair play as it actually looks to be very good. Only slight gripe is that 43 cases is a relatively small number of events for an analysis, but nothing looks untoward so far and there are bigger analyses to look forward to as the results come in.

&gt;Hyderabad, India, 03, March, 2021: Bharat Biotech, a global leader in vaccine innovation, developing vaccines for infectious diseases, today announced the first interim analysis of its BBV152 (COVAXIN¬Æ). The whole virion inactivated COVID-19 vaccine candidate demonstrated an interim vaccine efficacy of 81% in its Phase 3 clinical trial. The trials involved 25,800 subjects, the largest ever conducted in India, in partnership with the Indian Council of Medical Research.

&gt;‚ÄúToday is an important milestone in vaccine discovery, for science and our fight against coronavirus. With today‚Äôs results from our Phase 3 clinical trials, we have now reported data on our COVID-19 vaccine from Phase 1, 2, and 3 trials involving around 27,000 participants.

&gt;COVAXIN¬Æ demonstrates high clinical efficacy trend against COVID 19 but also significant immunogenicity against the rapidly emerging variants,‚Äù said Dr. Krishna Ella, Chairman &amp; Managing Director, Bharat Biotech.

...

&gt;The Phase 3 study enrolled 25,800 participants between 18-98 years of age, including 2,433 over the age of 60 and 4,500 with comorbidities. The primary endpoint of Phase 3 clinical trial is based on the first occurrence of PCR-confirmed symptomatic (mild, moderate, or severe) COVID-19 with onset at least 14 days after the second study vaccination in serologically negative (to SARS-CoV-2) adult participants at baseline.

&gt;**The first interim analysis is based on 43 cases, of which 36 cases of COVID-19 were observed in the placebo group versus 7 cases observed in the BBV152 (COVAXIN¬Æ) group, resulting in a point estimate of vaccine efficacy of 80.6%.**

&gt;The interim analysis included a preliminary review of the safety database, which showed that severe, serious, and medically attended adverse events occurred at low levels and were balanced between vaccine and placebo groups. The trial's conduct and monitoring are as per Good Clinical Practice guidelines and have been outsourced to IQVIA.

&gt;Analysis from the National Institute of Virology indicates that vaccine-induced antibodies can
neutralize the UK variant strains and other heterologous strains, which has been published in bioRxiv. https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.26.426986

&gt;Bharat Biotech expects to share further details of the trial results as additional data become available. An additional interim analysis is planned for 87 cases, and the final analysis is planned for 130 cases. All data from the second interim and final analyses will be shared via prepublication servers as well as submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication.",1614805256.0,0.0,22.0,N,,2021-03-03 15:00:56

https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/02/02/myths-of-vaccine-manufacturing

Now if we knew a priori a year ago that mRNA was going to be so successful there may have been an opportunity *then* to scale up all these previously obscure industries and production processes, but it was wise at the start of the pandemic not to put all of our vaccine eggs in one basket behind one technology.

And given that all of the resulting vaccine technologies have had at least one hit on a highly effective vaccine, that was still a good move.",1614813278.0,0.0,9.0,Y,gpjc17b,2021-03-03 17:14:38

**Background:** On 8th December 2020, deployment of the first vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 authorised for UK use, the mRNA-based vaccine BNT162b2, began, followed by the adenoviral vector vaccine ChAdOx1nCoV-19 on 4th January 2021. Initially care home-residents and staff, frontline healthcare workers and adults from age 80 were targeted. In phase 3 trials, BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1nCoV-19 demonstrated 95% and 70% efficacy, respectively, after two doses against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, few data exist regarding the effectiveness of these vaccines in elderly frail people. Evaluation following implementation to determine the effectiveness of one dose in reducing hospitalisations due to SARS-CoV-2 infection in elderly adults is urgent.

**Methods:** A prospective single-centre test-negative design case-control study of adults aged ‚â•80 years hospitalised with COVID-19 disease or other acute respiratory disease. We conducted logistic regression controlling for time (week), gender, index of multiple deprivations (IMD), and care residency status (CRS), and sensitivity analyses matched for time and gender using a conditional logistic model adjusting for IMD and CRS.

**Findings:** First dose vaccine effectiveness of BNT162b2 was 71.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 46.5-90.6). ChAdOx1nCoV-19 first dose vaccine effectiveness was 80.4% (95% CI 36.4-94.5). When effectiveness analysis for BNT162b2 was restricted to the period covered by ChAdOx1nCoV-19, the estimate was 79.3% (95% CI 47.0-92.5).

**Interpretation:** A single dose of either BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1nCoV-19 vaccine resulted in substantial reductions in the risk of COVID-19-related hospitalisation in elderly, frail patients with extensive co-morbid disease.",1614809851.0,0.0,8.0,N,,2021-03-03 16:17:31

**Background**

The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) variants threatens progress toward control of the Covid-19 pandemic. Evaluation of Covid-19 vaccine efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 variants is urgently needed to inform vaccine development and use.

**Methods**

In this phase 2a/b, multicenter, randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in South Africa, healthy human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative adults (18 to 84 years) or medically stable people living with HIV (PLWH) (18 to 84 years) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses, administered 21 days apart, of either NVX-CoV2373 nanoparticle vaccine (5 micrograms recombinant spike protein with 50 micrograms Matrix-M1 adjuvant) or placebo. The primary endpoints were safety and vaccine efficacy greater than or equal to 7 days following the second dose against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic Covid-19 in previously SARS-CoV-2 uninfected participants.

**Results**

A total of 4387 participants were randomized and dosed at least once, 2199 with NVX CoV2373 and 2188 with placebo. Approximately 30% of participants were seropositive at baseline. Among 2684 baseline seronegative participants (94% HIV negative; 6% PLWH), there were 15 and 29 predominantly mild to moderate Covid-19 cases in NVX CoV2373 and placebo recipients, respectively; vaccine efficacy was 49.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.1 to 72.8). Efficacy in HIV negative participants was 60.1% (95% CI: 19.9 to 80.1), and did not differ by baseline serostatus. Of the primary endpoint cases with available whole genome sequencing, 38 (92.7%) of 41 were the B.1.351 variant. Post-hoc vaccine efficacy against B.1.351 was 51.0% (95% CI: -0.6 to 76.2) in HIV-negative participants. Among placebo recipients, the incidence of symptomatic Covid-19 was similar in baseline seronegative vs baseline seropositive participants during the first 2 months of follow-up (5.3% vs 5.2%). Preliminary local and systemic reactogenicity were primarily mild to moderate and transient, and higher with NVX CoV2373; serious adverse events were rare in both groups.

**Conclusions**

The NVX-CoV2373 vaccine was efficacious in preventing Covid-19, which was predominantly mild to moderate and due to the B.1.351 variant, while evidence of prior infection with the presumptive original SARS CoV-2 did not confer protection against probable B.1.351 disease.

**Importance:** The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has infected over a hundred million people worldwide, with almost 2.5 million deaths at the date of this publication. In the United States, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were first administered to the public starting in December 2020, and no lactating women were included in the initial trials of safety/efficacy. Research on SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in lactating women and the potential transmission of passive immunity to the infant through breast milk is needed to guide patients, clinicians and policy makers during the worldwide effort to curb the spread of this virus.

**Objective:** To determine whether SARS-CoV-2 specific immunoglobins are found in breast milk post-vaccination, and to characterize the time course and types of immunoglobulins present. 

**Design:** Prospective cohort study

**Setting:** Providence Portland Medical Center, Oregon, USA

**Participants:** Six lactating women who planned to receive both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine between December 2020 and January 2021. Breast milk samples were collected pre-vaccination and at 11 additional timepoints, with last sample at 14 days post 2nd dose of vaccine.

**Exposure:** Two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

**Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s):** Levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA and IgG immunoglobulins in breast milk.

**Results:** In this cohort of 6 lactating women who received 2 doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, we observed significantly elevated levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgA antibodies in breast milk beginning at Day 7 after the initial vaccine dose, with an IgG-dominant response.

**Conclusions and Relevance:** We are the first to show that maternal vaccination results in SARS-CoV-2 specific immunoglobulins in breast milk that may be protective for infants.",1614728609.0,0.0,54.0,N,,2021-03-02 17:43:29

**Background**

Viral and immune kinetics in mild to moderate COVID-19 are understudied because of challenges inherent in longitudinal sampling of people who are infectious to others, feeling ill, yet are not hospitalized. In particular, sustained molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the upper respiratory tract (URT) in mild to moderate COVID-19 is common and confounds surveillance efforts in the community. We sought to identify host and immune determinants of prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection via longitudinal viral RNA, virus culture, and plasma and oral fluid antibody sampling in a prospective observational cohort study of adult outpatients with COVID-19. 

**Methods and Findings**

Samples from 95 non-hospitalized participants ‚â• 30 years old with recent COVID-19 diagnosis and known symptom onset date were analyzed. Participants self-collected mid-turbinate nasal, oropharyngeal (OP), and gingival crevicular fluid (oral fluid) samples at home and in a research clinic a median of 6 times over 1-3 months. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR performed on 507 URT samples revealed a median time to viral RNA clearance of the URT of 33.5 days. Sixteen nasal-OP samples collected 2-11 days post-symptom onset were virus culture positive out of 183 RT-PCR positive samples tested. All participants but one with positive virus culture were negative for concomitant oral fluid anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike-receptor binding domain (S-RBD) antibodies. The kinetics of oral fluid anti-SARS-Cov-2 antibodies were measured using a multiplex immunoassay. The mean time to first detection of oral fluid anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 8-13 days post-symptom onset. Associations of symptoms, host demographics, comorbidities, and immune kinetics with time to SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. A longer time to first detection of oral fluid anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibodies was independently associated with a longer time to SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA clearance (aHR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92-0.99, p=0.020). BMI ‚â• 25kg/m2 was also independently associated with a longer time to viral RNA clearance (aHR 0.37, 95% CI 0.18-0.78, p=0.009). Fever reported as one of first three COVID-19 symptoms was associated with shorter time to viral RNA clearance (aHR 2.06, 95% CI 1.02-4.18, p=0.044). Plasma titers of neutralizing antibodies, SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) antibodies, and S-receptor binding domain (S-RBD) antibodies were obtained at 1-4 months post-symptom onset. BMI was positively correlated with post-acute plasma SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibody titer and anti-S-RBD antibody titer.

**Conclusions**

In an intensively sampled cohort of 95 adult outpatients with COVID-19, we demonstrate that longer time to first detection of oral fluid SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, elevated BMI, and absence of early fever are independently associated with longer time to viral RNA clearance. This work provides insights into the host and immune factors most important for viral clearance in mild to moderate COVID-19.",1614808746.0,0.0,2.0,N,,2021-03-03 15:59:06

The type 2 coronavirus causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and produces pneumonia with pulmonary alveolar collapse. In some cases it also causes sepsis and septic shock. There is no specific treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Vitamin C (Vit C), Vitamin E (Vit E), N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and Melatonin (MT) increase the intracellular content of GSH, kidnap free radicals and protect DNA, proteins in the cytosol and lipids in cell membranes. Pentoxifylline (Px) has anti-inflammatory activities. Here we evaluate the effect of Vit C, Vit E, NAC, and MT plus Px in COVID-19 patients with moderate and severe pneumonia. 110 patients of either sex were included. They were divided into five groups with 22 patients each. Group 1 received Vit C+Px, group 2 Vit E+Px, group 3 NAC+Px, group 4 MT+Px, and group 5 only Px. Oxidative stress (OS) markers such as lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels, total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and nitrites (NO2-) were evaluated in plasma. The antioxidant therapy improved the survival scores including the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), the Acute Physiology and chronic Health Evaluation II (Apache II), the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), the Critical Illness Risk Score, Launched during COVID-19 crisis (COVIDGRAM) and the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). We found that LPO was elevated (p‚â§0.04) and TAC (p‚â§0.03), NO2-¬†(p‚â§0.04) and inflammation markers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6, p‚â§0.01) C reactive protein (CRP, p‚â§0.01) and procalcitonin (PCT, p‚â§0.05) were diminished in COVID-19 patients upon admission to the hospital. The different antioxidants reversed this alteration at the end of the treatment. The treatment with antioxidant supplements such as Vit C, E, NAC, and MT plus Px could decelerate the aggressive and lethal development of COVID-19. Antioxidant therapy can be effective in this pandemia since it improves the survival scores including SOFA, Apache II, SAPS II, COVIDGRAM, GCS by lowering the LPO, IL-6, CRP, PCT and increasing systemic TAC and NO2",1614829169.0,0.0,1.0,N,,2021-03-03 21:39:29

**Main outcome measures** Symptomatic PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalisations and deaths with COVID-19. 

**Results** Individuals aged &gt;=80 years vaccinated with BNT162b2 prior to 4th January, had a higher odds of testing positive in the first 9 days after vaccination (odds ratio up to 1.48, 95%CI 1.23-1.77), indicating that those initially targeted had a higher underlying risk of infection. Vaccine effectiveness was therefore estimated relative to the baseline post-vaccination period. Vaccine effects were noted from 10-13 days after vaccination, reaching an effectiveness of 70% (95% CI 59-78%) from 28-34 days, then plateauing. From 14 days after the second dose a vaccine effectiveness of 89% (95%CI: 85-93%) was seen. Individuals aged &gt;=70 years vaccinated from 4th January had a similar underlying risk of COVID-19 to unvaccinated individuals. With BNT162b2, vaccine effectiveness reached 61% (95%CI 51-69%) from 28-34 days after vaccination then plateaued. With the ChAdOx1 vaccine, vaccine effects were seen from 14-20 days after vaccination reaching an effectiveness of 60% (95%CI 41-73%) from 28-34 days and further increasing to 73% (95%CI 27-90%) from day 35 onwards. On top of the protection against symptomatic disease, cases who had been vaccinated with one dose of BNT162b2 had an additional 43% (95%CI 33-52%) lower risk of emergency hospitalisation and an additional 51% (95%CI 37-62%) lower risk of death. Cases who had been vaccinated with one dose of ChAdOx1 had an additional 37% (95% CI 3-59%) lower risk of emergency hospitalisation. There was insufficient follow-up to assess the effect of ChAdOx1 on mortality due to the later rollout of this vaccine. Combined with the effect against symptomatic disease, this indicates that a single dose of either vaccine is approximately 80% effective at preventing hospitalisation and a single dose of BNT162b2 is 85% effective at preventing death with COVID-19.

**Conclusion** Vaccination with either a single dose of BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 COVID-19 vaccination was associated with a significant reduction in symptomatic SARS-CoV2 positive cases in older adults with even greater protection against severe disease. Both vaccines show similar effects. Protection was maintained for the duration of follow-up (&gt;6 weeks). A second dose of BNT162b2 provides further protection against symptomatic disease but second doses of ChAdOx1 have not yet been rolled out in England. There is a clear effect of the vaccines against the UK variant of concern.",1614747066.0,0.0,16.0,N,,2021-03-02 22:51:06

&gt;In-person schooling has proved contentious and difficult to study throughout the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Data from a massive online survey in the United States indicates an increased risk of COVID-19-related outcomes among respondents living with a child attending school in-person. School-based mitigation measures are associated with significant reductions in risk, particularly daily symptoms screens, teacher masking, and closure of extra-curricular activities. With seven or more mitigation measures, the association between in-person schooling and COVID-19-related outcomes all but disappears. Teachers working outside the home were more likely to report COVID-19-related outcomes, but this association is similar to other occupations (e.g., healthcare, office work).

One third of COVID-19 patients develop significant neurological symptoms, yet SARS-CoV-2 is rarely detected in central nervous system (CNS) tissue, suggesting a potential role for parainfectious processes, including neuroimmune responses. We therefore examined immune parameters in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood samples from a cohort of patients with COVID-19 and significant neurological complications. We found divergent immunological responses in the CNS compartment, including increased levels of IL-12 and IL-12-associated innate and adaptive immune cell activation. Moreover, we found increased proportions of B cells in the CSF relative to the periphery and evidence of clonal expansion of CSF B cells, suggesting a divergent intrathecal humoral response to SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, all COVID-19 cases examined had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the CSF whose target epitopes diverged from serum antibodies. We directly examined whether CSF resident antibodies target self-antigens and found a significant burden of CNS autoimmunity, with the CSF from most patients recognizing neural self-antigens. Finally, we produced a panel of monoclonal antibodies from patients‚Äô CSF and show that these target both anti-viral and anti-neural antigens‚Äîincluding one mAb specific for the spike protein that also recognizes neural tissue. This exploratory immune survey reveals evidence of a compartmentalized and self-reactive immune response in the CNS meriting a more systematic evaluation of neurologically impaired COVID-19 patients.",1614744725.0,0.0,1.0,N,,2021-03-02 22:12:05

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants highlighted the need to better understand adaptive immune responses to this virus. It is important to address whether also CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses are affected, because of the role they play in disease resolution and modulation of COVID-19 disease severity. Here we performed a comprehensive analysis of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses from COVID-19 convalescent subjects recognizing the ancestral strain, compared to variant lineages B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, and CAL.20C as well as recipients of the Moderna (mRNA-1273) or Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT162b2) COVID-19 vaccines. Similarly, we demonstrate that the sequences of the vast majority of SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes are not affected by the mutations found in the variants analyzed. Overall, the results demonstrate that CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in convalescent COVID-19 subjects or COVID-19 mRNA vaccinees are not substantially affected by mutations found in the SARS-CoV-2 variants.",1614699223.0,0.0,32.0,N,,2021-03-02 09:33:43

The spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the prime target for vaccine development. The spike protein mediates both binding to host cells and membrane fusion and is also so far the only known viral target of neutralizing antibodies. Coronavirus spike pro- teins are large trimers that are relatively unstable, a feature that might be enhanced by the presence of a polybasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 spike. Exchange of K986 and V987 for prolines has been shown to stabilize the trimers of SARS-CoV-1 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike proteins. Here, we test multi- ple versions of a soluble spike protein for their immunogenicity and protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in a mouse model that transiently expresses human an- giotensin-converting enzyme 2 via adenovirus transduction. Variants tested include spike proteins with a deleted polybasic cleavage site, proline mutations, or a combina- tion thereof, besides the wild-type protein. While all versions of the protein were able to induce neutralizing antibodies, only the antigen with both a deleted cleavage site and the K986P and V987P (PP) mutations completely protected from challenge in this mouse model.

IMPORTANCE 

A vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed. A better understanding of antigen design and attributes that vaccine candidates need to have to induce protective immunity is of high importance. The data presented here validate the choice of antigens that contain the PP mutations and suggest that deletion of the polybasic cleavage site may lead to a further-optimized design.",1614746081.0,0.0,1.0,N,,2021-03-02 22:34:41

COVID-19 manifests with a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes that are characterized by exaggerated and misdirected host immune responses1‚Äì8. While pathological innate immune activation is well documented in severe disease1, the impact of autoantibodies on disease progression is less defined. Here, we used a high-throughput autoantibody discovery technique called Rapid Extracellular Antigen Profiling (REAP) to screen a cohort of 194 SARS-CoV-2 infected COVID-19 patients and healthcare workers for autoantibodies against 2,770 extracellular and secreted proteins (the ‚Äúexoproteome‚Äù). We found that COVID-19 patients exhibit dramatic increases in autoantibody reactivities compared to uninfected controls, with a high prevalence of autoantibodies against immunomodulatory proteins including cytokines, chemokines, complement components, and cell surface proteins. We established that these autoantibodies perturb immune function and impair virological control by inhibiting immunoreceptor signaling and by altering peripheral immune cell composition, and found that murine surrogates of these autoantibodies exacerbate disease severity in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Analysis of autoantibodies against tissue-associated antigens revealed associations with specific clinical characteristics and disease severity. In summary, these findings implicate a pathological role for exoproteome-directed autoantibodies in COVID-19 with diverse impacts on immune functionality and associations with clinical outcomes.

Humoral immunity plays dichotomous roles in COVID-19. Although neutralizing antibodies afford protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection9,10, growing evidence suggests that dysregulated humoral immunity also contributes to the characteristic immunopathology of COVID-1911‚Äì17. For example, subsets of COVID-19 patients commonly exhibit an expansion of pathological extrafollicular B cell populations (IgD- /CD27- double negative, DN) that have been associated with autoantibody production in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients12,18. Furthermore, recent reports have identified isolated autoantibody reactivities in COVID-19 patients, including those that are characteristic of systemic autoimmune diseases such as antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor (anti-IgG-Fc antibodies), antiphospholipid antibodies, and antibodies against type 1 interferons (IFN-I)15‚Äì17. Importantly, some autoantibodies, particularly neutralizing antibodies against IFN-I, appear to directly contribute to COVID-19 pathophysiology by antagonizing innate antiviral responses11. While striking examples of disease-modifying autoantibody responses have been described, the full breadth of autoantibody reactivities in COVID-19 and their immunological and clinical impacts remain undetermined at a proteome-scale. We therefore sought to identify functional autoantibody responses in COVID-19 patients by screening for autoantibody reactivities against the human exoproteome (the set of extracellular and secreted proteins in the proteome).",1614744929.0,0.0,2.0,N,,2021-03-02 22:15:29

County officials were in the dark when DeSantis showed up with the vaccines, and the task of finding 3,000 people to vaccinate on short notice fell to the senior community. Residents and volunteers notified their friends and neighbors. And the complex, which had requested the clinic, was bombarded with phone calls.

The pandemic has served to polarize even further. 

States like TX and FL are providing glimpses of the dystopian nightmare that truly unchecked ""free market"" would create -- setting up vaccination clinics for only wealth neighborhoods, utilities that fail and times of urgent need, and a government that literally states that business success is more important than citizen's lives (worse yet, make good on that rhetoric through executive action and laws).

Even in Massachusetts we're seeing how the haves and have nots are being forced to choose between health and livelihood. There's been no substantial change to protect or reward our essential workers -- those that put the food and supplies in our homes -- they weren't even given priority access to vaccinations, or any wage improvements, which was the least we could do as a state. We've set a moratorium on evictions, but there is no plan for the people who are being left behind, they're likely to simply be evicted when things loosen up and then become ""untouchable"" to new landlords who see that history, how do we solve that?

lwa4r9,gph3ups,t2_5d4r3fng,"&gt;suicides are skyrocketing 

While there is uncertainty, there is currently no evidence to support this in the United States. There are worrying signs of increased risk of suicide, like reported anxiety, and some shifts between suicide rates of some subgroups in certain locations, but no data suggesting a significant overall change in suicide rates one way or the other in the US since the pandemic began. Data on recent months in the US is notably still incomplete, but there are no preliminary signs of increased rates.

A December 2020 [Newsweek article](https://www.newsweek.com/suicide-rate-dropped-lowest-level-since-1999-last-year-trend-may-not-continue-2020-1556846) explained:

&gt;""We do not yet know about suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic because the United States does not collect suicide data in real time, therefore, claims about increasing suicide rates during COVID-19 are not based in current available data and are unfounded,"" said American Foundation for Suicide Prevention Chief Medical Officer Christine Moutier in a Tuesday statement. ""Emerging data from several countries show no evidence of increased suicide rates during the first few months of the pandemic.""

Another recent discussion of the issue was presented in a January 2021 article in *The New York Times Magazine,* entitled ""[Will the Pandemic Result in More Suicides?""](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/21/magazine/will-the-pandemic-result-in-more-suicides.html).

There was a recent study on increased suicide rates in Japan, specifically of women.

I think it's also worth keeping in perspective that there are normally around 50,000 suicide deaths per year in the US, compared to around 500,000 deaths from COVID in the past year.",1614757478.0,0.0,6.0,Y,gpgsqii,2021-03-03 01:44:38

We've administered 2 million, so 8 million to go, assuming two doses per person.  Assuming an even split between Moderna, Pfizer, and J&amp;J going forward, each can give 2 million doses, since J&amp;J's 2 million would actually ""count"" for 4 million doses.

It only feels like a little, stinging poke and lasted no more than 5 seconds. If the pain aspect of needles bothers you, icing the spot or giving it a pinch right before are great ideas. You could also purchase a topical numbing cream/gel at any drugstore.

For me, it‚Äôs not about the pain, but about the needle being in my body. To combat this, I like to chat as casually as possible with the nurse about literally anything else... in this case she saw my 21st birthday was coming up, so I asked her if she had any recommendations for places that serve good drinks in our area.

I think if you did, you should absolutely feel guilty and we shouldnt be encouraging ANYONE to sign up if they dont qualify. I know people are saying ""but they were going to waste doses"" but lets be clear: open appointments dont always mean wasted doses. Open appointments just mean they can schedule someone. ONCE someone is scheduled and they know how many vaccinations that day, then they will take out vials. 

But that means if you see an open appt and you sign up, theyre going to thaw a vial. And if it turns out that you dont qualify and they have to send you home, its a waste vial. so absolutely anyone should feel guilty about signing up for appts theyre ineligible for. Not only does it not help vaccine waste, it can cause it if they stick to their policy which most will. 

And people getting appointments is a HUGE ISSUE when they dont qualify. If you dont qualify, dont sign up guys. Please dont do it. Its not ethical, its not helping, it is jumping the line. 

What is ethical? Getting a leftover dose. leftover doses are going to be wasted and they should go in any arm. How can you get one? Ask about waitlists for leftover doses at the end of the day.

A study published in 1998 - since discredited and withdrawn - associated the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine with autism. But the concern it sparked among parents lives on.

‚ÄúPeople didn't like that they were about to be injected with a biological product they didn't understand, and that was the birth of anti-vaccine movements,‚Äù Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children‚Äôs Hospital of Philadelphia, told ABC.

Experts say, there‚Äôs work to be done to ensure that happens. As distribution of the first 2.9 million doses kicks into gear, public health experts prepare to parse fact from fiction.

‚ÄúThere's a lot of work that has to be done to ensure that the vaccines that come forward that we trust in them, that we trusted the science was done right,‚Äù Besser said after months of whiplashed messaging -- and years of systemic inequality. ‚ÄúA casualty of that approach is trust.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think it's okay to be scared,‚Äù ABC Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Jen Ashton said. ‚ÄúIt's okay to acknowledge that - it means you've been paying attention. But in medicine and science, we have to go on facts, not fear.‚Äù",1607994435.0,0.0,1.0,N,,2020-12-14 19:07:15

lvflrq,gpcehak,t2_4uxar,"I‚Äôm not an expert in vaccines, but I do know a thing or two about talking to antivaxxers and conspiracy theorists. Don‚Äôt get bogged down in making broad claims about vaccines as a whole, because then all it takes is one loophole to ‚Äúdiscredit‚Äù your entire argument. She isn‚Äôt an antivaxxer, so the last thing you want to do is to send her down the rabbit hole (which is a *very* slippery slope.) You aren‚Äôt talking about all vaccines here, you‚Äôre talking about a literal handful of vaccines in particular, so focus on the specifics of the COVID vaccines. 

There‚Äôs been a fair bit of misinformation going around on Instagram / Facebook, including what appear to be fake screen shots warning of fertility impacts, but as far as I can tell they‚Äôre just that: fake. The EUAs and information for prescribers and recipients for each vaccine are public, and while there is some language about birth defects etc. the context is important because it‚Äôs specifically regarding what legally must be reported to VAERS with *any* vaccine ‚Äî not evidence of side effects ‚Äî and the prevalence of pregnancy-related issues in all people, vaccinated or not. The EUAs also include fun information like the fact that only 0.3% of recipients in the trial had any sort of adverse reaction (swelling, pain, etc.), but also that 0.2% of people who got the *placebo* reported the same side effects. 

The other reason you don‚Äôt want to start citing other vaccines is that the COVID vaccines (in particular the Modern and Pfizer ones) *are* somewhat new technology. It‚Äôs totally normal and OK to be nervous about that, but despite the misinformation, it‚Äôs not as scary as it sounds. No, they don‚Äôt modify your DNA ‚Äî they use modified RNA (different than DNA) as a vector to ‚Äúteach‚Äù your body how to recognize the characteristic protein spike of COVID-19 and manufacture the antibody ‚Äî which isn‚Äôt at all unlike how traditional vaccines that use a dead virus work. There‚Äôs also this idea floating around that it isn‚Äôt even a vaccine because it doesn‚Äôt prevent you from getting infected. While it‚Äôs true that there isn‚Äôt proof that they prevent infection, they do prevent the virus from replicating and creating symptoms, and that‚Äôs literally one of the ways that some traditional vaccines operate (search term: therapeutic vaccine). They‚Äôve also shown to be almost 100% effective in eliminating serious cases ‚Äî that ‚Äú95%‚Äù number you see floating around is very misleading because it‚Äôs looking at all cases ‚Äî including totally asymptomatic ones or ones that amount to the sniffles (the vast majority). It *might* not stop the virus from getting into your body, but it *will* make you drastically less likely to get sick from it. 

There‚Äôs no evidence I can find of reproductive effects from any of the COVID vaccines ‚Äî but there *is* evidence of reproductive effects from getting a symptomatic case COVID virus. 

The most important thing in all of this though isn‚Äôt the information ‚Äî it‚Äôs how you communicate with her. ‚ÄúHow to Win Friends and Influence People‚Äù is, IMO, a terribly overrated book that everyone should read because the core tenants are spot on. The best way to win an argument is not to have one. Empathize with her, listen to her, and don‚Äôt preach, criticize or shun. I‚Äôve spent more hours than I can count purposefully spelunking into the QAnon / anti-vaccine rabbit hole (along with most other conspiracy theories) and it‚Äôs definitely one of the most dangerous ones I‚Äôve come across for the amount of brain power it takes to parse out and refute the various claims. I‚Äôm naturally an information junky who‚Äôs skeptical of literally everything and actually enjoys and does this kind of thing professionally, and while I might have more of a natural immunity to it than some, I don‚Äôt fault people for falling down the rabbit hole. The way they twist / misuse information is *masterful.* 

Oof, that was a lot more long-winded and rambly than I intended.  Sorry. 

If you want to show her information, I‚Äôd stick to the primary sources like the EUAs because it‚Äôs harder to just say ‚Äúfake news‚Äù (or whatever), but if you want some background info for yourself there‚Äôs a great podcast called ‚ÄúConspirituality‚Äù that touches on this stuff from a hippie wellness perspective, and on the flip side Ron Bailey over at Reason Magazine has done some great reporting on this stuff. He‚Äôs consistently had some of the most clear-headed and level takes since the beginning of the pandemic. 

Good luck!

(BTW, it‚Äôs ‚Äúaffect‚Äù in this case. The best way to remember it is think ‚Äúa‚Äù for ‚Äúaction.‚Äù An affect is an action, and an effect is a thing ‚Äî there‚Äôs some tricky exceptions, but TBH it‚Äôs not worth worrying about. Just use that rule and 99.5% of the time you‚Äôll be correct, and if you‚Äôre wrong only 0.1% of people or so will notice anyway).",1614662747.0,0.0,13.0,N,,2021-03-01 23:25:47

To finish, since we already know it gives out side effects, I do not see the utility of the doing the vaccine as a healthy human being. If you are in a very bad health position, it can be a good idea to vaccinate yourself, but if you are in a respectable enough range for the virus not to cause severely negative effects on you, the vaccine is not necessary, since it doesn't protect you 100%, the only thing you will get is a bunch of weird side effects. I think we need to wait for the vaccine to advance in years to know its true side effects list.

About this Event

IF THIS DOESN'T CONCERN YOU, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT SHOULD!

Should me and my family get vaccinated? Is it safe? What happens if I don‚Äôt get vaccinated? Why am I not given priorities to vaccination? How do decisions made by the governments and big companies affect our vaccination access? ü§î

As the pandemic stretches on into the new phase where the vaccines have been developed, questions about **safety, distribution and ethics** are hotly debated. Relevant issues revolving around **equality, free will and geopolitics** also emerged. üó£

In this multidisciplinary panel discussion, we invited experts from the fields of **philosophy, public health, public policy, medicine, bioethics, political economy and law** to discuss the **most in-demand questions revolving around the vaccines**, addressing your doubts and debunking falsehoods. ‚ÄºÔ∏è

You will walk away with a more informed mind, and are able to make a more educated decision for yourself, your family and your country. üß†üí°

Join us on Saturday, March 6, where we bring together international experts from different industries to discuss on the issues surrounding the COVID-19 vaccines, just as they are being rolled out. üî•

REGISTER HERE: [https://myphilsoc-vaccine.eventbrite.com/?aff=RedditCOVID19](https://myphilsoc-vaccine.eventbrite.com/?aff=RedditCOVID19)

Some **issues that will be discussed** include:

üíâ What are your opinions on expedited trials and manufacturing processes of vaccines? Should people avoid vaccination due to its expedited manufacturing process?

üíâ For people who reject vaccinations, what are the spectrum of reasons? Are they all anti-vaxxers?

üíâ Is it ethical to pursue the natural herd immunity strategy?

üíâ Judging by the current scenario in your country, do you think we should mandate vaccination?

**Expert Panelists** for this Event Are:

(www.pfizer.com/health/coronavirus/updates)


The vaccine has shown a 95% effectivity preventing COVID-19, also, dealing with the virus by yourself will not increase ur inmunity against it, in fact, it is more dangerous bc u can lose ur sense of smelling, and end with slightly damaged lungs (i think) and there is the possibility of ending in the ICU because of complications. Is much safer inoculating ourself, why? You are not injecting yourself the virus, only a copy of the protein spike of the virus, not the inactivated virus, is important to know that the vaccine will not manipulate your DNA. To summarize a little, the against naturally adquiring it  vs  inoculating yourself, the safer option is the last one, inoculation by far.


Respecting your family member, ask where they got that info, non-official sites often provide misleading/fake info so beware, only try to search info with official sites, like the CDC, WHO, Pfizer, BioNTech.

It's the same reason why surprise inspections exist in the dining industry. You can't trust all establishments to do the right thing. The pandemic won't last forever anyway. These are temporary measures which are keeping the public's health at the forefront. On the flip side, the govt has a responsibility to provide relief to businesses that are negatively impacted by the newer health safety guidelines if it can. Well guess what? Good thing we pay taxes!

lwva95,gpjciyh,t2_4g4xj7dq,"Text:

A crucial wing of the immune system appears to be just as good at recognising all the new coronavirus variants, a study has found.

In laboratory tests, T-cell responses in those vaccinated or previously infected with coronavirus were largely unaffected by each of the key variants. This included the new Brazilian variant, found in small numbers in the UK last week.

The new findings suggest that even if people are able to be reinfected by the variants, some of which are believed to partially evade our first immune response, the body will have key tools for preventing severe disease.

However, the scientists behind the findings cautioned that the protective abilities of the  T-cell response remained to be proven in the field.

‚ÄúIf you have a good T-cell response you may not be able to prevent infection, but you should be able to soften the blow,‚Äù said Professor Alessandro Sette, from the La Jolla Institute for Immunology. ‚ÄúThat is important. The opposite scenario would have been really concerning, if the new variants had been able to evade both the antibody response and the T-cell response.‚Äù

After infection or vaccination, people produce antibodies specific to the coronavirus. These recognise and latch on to part of the spike the virus uses to infect cells ‚Äî effectively blocking it.

‚ÄúBasically you create a wall and the virus bounces off that wall,‚Äù said Sette. ‚ÄúThis is sterilizing immunity.‚Äù

One of the concerns about new variants, particularly those from South  Africa and Brazil, is they contain a mutation that changes the shape of  the spike, meaning they evade antibodies built up against the old version.

However, that is only the first line of defence. We know from vaccine trials that even if people do become infected following vaccination, they are still at least 50 per cent less likely to develop severe disease compared to those who were infected without being vaccinated.

The second line of defence that helps them fight off Covid comes in part from T-cells, which are harder to trick.

‚ÄúOne of the things that T-cells do is kill infected cells or create an antiviral response,‚Äù said Sette. ‚ÄúSo, if you have T-cells you may not prevent the infection, but you may lessen the severity of the disease. You may also shorten the duration of a disease.‚Äù

Unlike antibodies, these T-cells home in on a larger portion of the virus‚Äôs spike, meaning it has to change more significantly to elude them.

Because each person‚Äôs T-cells choose these larger sections of viral proteins at random, it also means it‚Äôs harder for the virus to evolve in a way that it evades them at a population level. Even if it finds a way to trick one person, that does not mean it will trick the person they infect.

Sette‚Äôs research, published ahead of peer review, used blood taken from people who had received the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines or been naturally infected. It showed that while their antibody response might be reduced, their T-cell response held up well.

‚ÄúPutting two and two together you would imagine that if you have a good T-cell response you would be able to lessen symptoms.‚Äù

The findings will be comforting for Britain‚Äôs vaccine strategy, however public health officials cautioned it was still important to prevent the spread of new variants. No protection is perfect, and any variant that can infect people better ‚Äî even only mildly ‚Äî will risk slowing the raising of lockdown.

Sette said it will also be key to see what happens in the real world. Currently some cities in South America that are believed to have had high infection levels are seeing a second spike in hospitalisations, apparently caused by the new Brazilian variant.

This  includes places like Leticia in Colombia, where studies suggest that around 60 per cent of the population were previously infected with the old variant. This at least suggests that some people are being reinfected and ending up in hospital.",1614811033.0,0.0,70.0,N,,3/3/21 16:37

It's unclear if going with just 1 shot for so long would keep all the new variants at bay. From what I can tell, their decision was based on severely strained logistics, as well as the assumption (not the hard data) that the impact of 1 shot will last for a while.

&gt; Gov. Jay Inslee on Tuesday afternoon said teachers and licensed child care workers could seek doses of COVID-19 vaccines immediately, assenting to new directions from the federal government.

&gt; &amp;quot;We will continue the current state plans and goals to focus on those most at risk, including older adults and those facing the greatest equity gaps,&amp;quot; Inslee said, adding that he would soon announce when vaccine priority would open to include those who work in grocery stores, farmworkers, food processors, bus drivers and corrections workers.

&gt; Just last week, a group of state lawmakers from Seattle tried to lobby state and city officials to speed up the process for educators as Seattle Public Schools and its teachers union remained at an impasse over reopening.

lvwhfw,gpeblrm,t2_z2q3g,"Nothing 100%, but I have a good estimate, and I think we‚Äôll likely be moving forward next week at the latest, but quite possibly this week.

So the DOH mentioned that they intended to move forward to the next tier once 50% of currently eligible people have gotten their first shot. According to the vaccine tab on [the DOH Covid Dashboard](https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/COVID19/DataDashboard), as of Feb 27th, we‚Äôve delivered ~1,080,000 first doses. Now, [here on page 46](https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/1600/coronavirus/820-112-InterimVaccineAllocationPrioritization.pdf) we were given a table of how many people are estimated to be eligible in each phase (and this estimate should be what they‚Äôre using to determine that 50% number), and we can see here that 1A1, 1A2, and 1B1 combine to be ~2,300,000 people eligible right now, making the point where we move on at 1,115,000 first doses, which means we only need ~70,000 more from where we were on Feb 27th. Now the most recent update we‚Äôve gotten on first/second dose split was [here](https://twitter.com/wadepthealth/status/1364641773667155971?s=21), putting us at around 22,000 first doses a day, which puts us on pace to hit that 50% number by March 3rd. Now keep in mind, this is even without the J&amp;J vaccine

Now, I imagine there‚Äôs some worry at the DOH about how willing people are to take the J&amp;J vaccine given its lower published efficacy since this seems to be a major public health push everywhere, so given that we‚Äôre already about to hit a point where we were initially looking to move on to 1B2 and we‚Äôre already about to get ~60,000 J&amp;J doses, they may feel some pressure to open 1B2 to avoid a bottleneck in demand. 

Now one more thing, if you noticed from the table presenting how big each phase is, you‚Äôll see that 1B2 is only ~95,000 people and we‚Äôre looking to be able to do ~82,000 first doses this week once J&amp;J is factored in (I know J&amp;J is only one dose, but for my purposes here it makes sense to consider it a first dose), and given that we‚Äôre definitely not going to get 100% uptake among those eligible in 1B2, it looks like we‚Äôre about to zoom through 1B2 very fast, so fast that I could see them doing something like opening up 1B2 and 1B3 simultaneously and just reserve a certain amount of the doses for 1B2 only (like how they pivoted to make all the mass vaccination sites only 2nd doses recently for about a week to catch us up on 2nd doses), I could see them open up to 1B2 for mass vaccination sites and open up to 1B3 for everywhere else. This last bit is only speculation but I imagine we won‚Äôt spend much time in 1B2 before moving on to 1B3 since our rate of vaccination is very fast compared to the amount of 1B2 people, less than a week‚Äôs worth

I'll give you a hint: tribal vaccine allocations come from the federal government directly, not the state.

lveiby,gpbm0x6,t2_9i4sz,"There is some line cutting going on for sure.

But more so, there are people who are opportunistically going to vaccination sites and seeing if there are extra vaccines left at the end of the day, that they need to essentially ""use or lose"".  The first group may be taking someone in regions spot, the second group is just taking a vaccine that will be otherwise lost.

Here's two things that help me from wasting time getting angry:    
1) From a broad perspective, the goal is to get as many people as possible the vaccine as soon as possible.  A broadly vaccinated population is what is eventually going to bring down case counts to a level we can open up society again.  So that's why they are focused more on getting vaccines out than policing.

2) People who are being selfish on cutting corners to get themselves vaccinated first, are probably the same people do selfish things to spread the virus in general.  So in my opinion, getting the ""selfish idiot"" group prioritized is probably going to be super efficient in driving down counts and opening things up.",1614650158.0,0.0,60.0,N,,2021-03-01 19:55:58

In an ideal world, yes, but this doesn't usually play out. I booked my friend an appointment in Pierce even though he lives in King. I couldn't find him an appointment in King. He's a 72-year-old Black cancer survivor. I filled out his questionnaire for him and told no lies. He wasn't turned away.

Some sites will turn away people who don't live in the immediate area, but most won't.",1614652935.0,0.0,19.0,N,,2021-03-01 20:42:15

I looked this up a month or so ago and the report was that the state advised to stay in state. There was nothing about staying in county though. Not even a ‚Äúplease stay in county‚Äù statement. 

My dad is eligible and I had to get him a shot in another country and I have no problems with that. The whole allocation process has been a shit show IMO and the state asked for this behavior as a result of the allocation.

lveiby,gpcnvm3,t2_a4l3bkkb,"The short answer is that you do not HAVE to be a resident of a county to get vaccinated there. It is recommended because of the allocations you mentioned that you try to stick with your own county. However, it is very hard (at least for me) to tell an 85-year old senior with health complications who has been trying for months now to get an appointment for the vaccine that they should not accept an available appointment in another county if they can get it and can get there. Some counties seem to have more appointment availability than others, perhaps because of lower demand, less community outreach, more complicated scheduling that people aren't figuring out, or some other factor. I do not know about Lewis county's allocation versus other counties' allocations, but there are still many eligible seniors in most counties who are still looking for vaccines because demand in general has outstripped supply. Many of them are spending time every day trying to get an appointment somewhere, anywhere.",1614667196.0,0.0,5.0,N,,2021-03-02 00:39:56

They‚Äôre eligible in their county, but their town made an agreement with the county they‚Äôd be distributing vaccines themselves without the county help, so anyone in said town is not allowed to go to a county vaccine site.

lveiby,gpc1w5e,t2_4cnz63qj,"I think the vaccines are supposed to be allocated by eligible population, but there are distribution issues that complicate this. They‚Äôre only giving vaccines to specific hospitals and organizations‚Äîboth because of distribution logistics and the need for cold storage. And not all counties are alike on this. The bigger population centers are going to have bigger and better facilities and thus more vaccines. It sucks, but it‚Äôs hard to avoid.

As for people leaving their county, I think it‚Äôs mostly just eligible people looking anywhere for a shot. My mom‚Äîin Snohomish County‚Äîgot her shots in King County.

I know people drive to Ellensburg's DMV because its quicker even when driving 100 miles to get here, but come on!  We don't need people with the means to do so to come here and take a vaccine away from people it was allocated for.

I also know people are lying on questionnaires. A friend posted on IG about getting her 1st shot and my wife asked how, she said "" I just answered the questions and they said I qualify"".

She's incredibly fat, said she has asthma, and ""lives in a multi-generational home"". She is 25 and her and her husband live with her dad who is in his 40s!  But as another commenter said, she is one that would do selfish things to spread the virus in general and in fact already has before. 

 I fear though with people like that, that they think it magically makes them immune from getting and spreading the virus to others so they can do what ever they want.
